My name is Wesley Lynch. I am a recent graduate from the Amped Workforce Technology Training program. Im now attempting to complet my pre-work for code you. Im 36 years old and looking to find an entry level position in Information Technology.
I have worked various roles in other positions including, Manage, Captain, Supervisor. I once managed a popular mobile phone store and did very well before returning to the food service industry. Information Technology, computers, coding, programing and learing in general has always excited me. Until now learning more seemed just out of reach. Im optimistic about Code You and future opportunities.
